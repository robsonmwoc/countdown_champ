# Countdown Champ - Learning ReactJS

This is a `Countdown` and `Stopwatch` application built using ReactJS integrated with [SemanticUI toolkit](https://react.semantic-ui.com) for learning purposes.

The original app, presented in the course [ReactJS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps](https://www.udemy.com/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps/), uses the React Bootstrap. I'm particularly like SemanticUI more than Bootstrap, maily the integration with ReactJS.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of the Create React App [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
